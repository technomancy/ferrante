* Mirah Bugs?
** CONSTANTS = "foo"
** @@class_variables.nil?
** futures
** loop => while true =\
** can't override finish
** can't infer double => float
** can't refer to nested constants
* Ugly things to clean up
** Auto-generate resources from yaml, etc.
** all the this=self stuff
** json from an inputstream
** appengine-sdk gem doesn't place appcfg.sh on path
