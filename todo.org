** GET /$ID
   - Triggers Follow activity
   - May confirm, which goes to POST
   - May cancel, which goes to DELETE
** POST /$ID
   - sets followed_at
** PUT /$ID?latitude=44.2424&longitude=133.9014&name=follower
   - sets your lat, lng, ping_at
   - returns other's lat, lng
** DELETE /$ID?name=leader
   - sets ended_at, ended_by
** DONE share code for error cases
** TODO all links should fall back to splash for browser

* Data Model

* Mirah Bugs?
** CONSTANTS = "foo"
** @@class_variables.nil?
** futures
** loop => while true =\
** can't override finish
** can't infer double => float
** can't refer to nested constants
** can't access R resource classes
** question marks in class method names cause dex failures
** appengine_tasks is in mirah instead of dubious; huh?
*** --address=localhost hardcoded into appengine_tasks.
* Ugly things to clean up
** Auto-generate resources from yaml, etc.
** all the this=self stuff
** json from an inputstream
** appengine-sdk gem doesn't place appcfg.sh on path
